R\+A\+I\+I-\/based slot object which will automatically call Connect and Disconnect on construction and destruction, respectively. This prevents dangling slots since \mbox{\hyperlink{classxu_1_1_signal}{Signal}} is not aware that a member function pointer instance is no longer valid and will wrongly continue to blindly invoke it.
